# Download

## Desktop App

**[Download from GitHub Releases →](https://github.com/auditomatic/lite-app/releases)**

Choose the version for your operating system from the GitHub releases page.

The desktop app and web version have identical features, but the desktop app runs in an isolated browser, which makes it more efficient and secure if your browser is hacked. 

**System Requirements:** Windows 7+, macOS 10.15+ (Catalina), or Ubuntu 18.04+

**Installation:** Download installer → Run → Configure API keys

## Web App
