# Getting Started

## The 5-Minute Workflow

**Create Template → Add Variables → Configure Models → Run Trial → Results**

Auditomatic makes it simple to test how LLM responses vary across systematic changes. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Create a Template (30 seconds)

Write a prompt with variables in double curly braces:

```
Rate this job candidate: {{name}} has a degree in {{major}} from {{university}}. 
Give a score from 1-10.
```

### 2. Add Variables (1 minute)

Create lists of values to test:
- **Names**: Chad, Lisa, Tyrone, Priyanka, etc.
- **Majors**: Computer Science, Art History, Engineering
- **Universities**: Harvard, Community College, State University

### 3. Configure Models (30 seconds)

Select which LLMs to test:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Local models (Ollama)

### 4. Run Trial (2 minutes)

Hit "Start Trial" - Auditomatic will:
- Generate all combinations (name × major × university)
- Send prompts to selected models
- Show results in real-time

### 5. See Results (1 minute)

View results in a live table showing patterns:
- Which names get higher scores?
- Do certain majors get preferred?
- How do models differ?

## Export for Analysis

Export results as CSV, Excel, or JSON for further statistical analysis in your preferred tool.

## Use Cases

- **Bias Testing**: Test hiring, lending, or admission scenarios
- **Content Variation**: Test marketing copy across demographics  
- **Response Analysis**: Understand model behavior patterns
- **Prompt Engineering**: Find what works best
