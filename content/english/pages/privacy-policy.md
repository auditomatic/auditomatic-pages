## Overview

Auditomatic is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy covers:

- **auditomatic.org** (this documentation website)
- **lite.auditomatic.org** (the web application)
- **Auditomatic Desktop App** (downloadable application)

All three properties follow the same privacy practices and collect the same minimal, anonymous analytics data.

## Data Collection

### Web Analytics

When you visit auditomatic.org, lite.auditomatic.org, or launch the desktop app, we send one anonymous counter to a third-party server to track usage. We use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) for anonymous web analytics. GoatCounter collects only aggregate, non-personal data to help us understand how people use Auditomatic.

**What GoatCounter collects:**
- Operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Safari)
- Display size (screen resolution)
- Referring URL (the page you came from)
- Country (based on IP address, but IP addresses are not stored)

**What GoatCounter does NOT collect:**
- Personal identifying information
- Individual user tracking
- Cookies requiring consent
- Precise location data
- Browsing history across sites

GoatCounter stores only computed aggregate data (e.g., "40 people used Firefox today") rather than individual pageviews. It is designed to make it impossible to identify any specific person, even with full database access.

### No Tracking or Cookies

We do not use cookies that require consent under GDPR. GoatCounter operates without persistent user identifiers or cross-site tracking.

## The Auditomatic Applications

Both the web application (lite.auditomatic.org) and desktop application run entirely on your device. They do not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on our servers. All data processing happens locally:

- **Your LLM API keys** remain on your device
- **Your evaluation data** stays on your device
- **Your prompts and results** are never sent to our servers

The only data sent from any Auditomatic property is the single anonymous GoatCounter analytics ping described above.

## Data Usage

The aggregate analytics data helps us:
- Understand how many people are using Auditomatic across different countries and systems
- Identify technical issues (e.g., browser compatibility)
- Improve the website and application experience

## Legal Basis

We collect this anonymous analytics data on the basis of legitimate interest: it is reasonable for a website owner to understand how many people visit their site, similar to a physical store counting customers who enter.

## Your Rights

Because we do not collect personally identifiable information, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. All data collected is anonymous and aggregated.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this URL.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/auditomatic/lite-app) or auditomatic@stuartgeiger.com.
