## Overview

Auditomatic is committed to protecting your privacy and is designed as a local-first in-browser or standalone desktop app to this end. This privacy policy covers:

- **auditomatic.org** (this documentation website)
- **lite.auditomatic.org** (the web application)
- **Auditomatic Desktop App** (downloadable application)

## Data Collection

### Documentation Website (auditomatic.org)

This documentation website does not collect any analytics or tracking data. No cookies, trackers, or analytics scripts are used on auditomatic.org.

### Web Application and Desktop App Analytics

**The web application (lite.auditomatic.org) and desktop application offer optional anonymous usage analytics that require your explicit consent.** When you first use the app, you will be asked whether you want to enable anonymous usage statistics via [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/). You can choose to opt in or opt out, and you can change this setting at any time in the app's settings.

If you opt in, GoatCounter collects only aggregate, non-personal data to help us understand how people use Auditomatic.

**What GoatCounter collects:**
- Operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Safari)
- Display size (screen resolution)
- Referring URL (the page you came from)
- Country (based on IP address, but IP addresses are not stored)

**What GoatCounter does NOT collect:**
- Personal identifying information
- Individual user tracking
- Cookies requiring consent
- Precise location data
- Browsing history across sites
- Your templates, prompts, or API responses

GoatCounter stores only computed aggregate data (e.g., "40 people used the web app in the U.S. with Firefox on Windows today") rather than individual pageviews. It is designed to make it impossible to identify any specific person, even with full database access.

**If you opt out or do not consent, no analytics data will be collected from your use of the application.**

## The Auditomatic Applications

Both the web application (lite.auditomatic.org) and desktop application run entirely on your device. Except for the optional GoatCounter analytics (if you opt in), the app does not collect, transmit, or store any of your data to our servers. However, the apps let you send API requests to external LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter, which have their own privacy policies and may retain or train on your data. Except for optional GoatCounter analytics and sending API requests to these providers, all other data processing happens locally in the app:

- **Your LLM API keys** remain on your device
- **Your evaluation data** stays on your device
- **Your prompts and results from LLM API providers** are never sent to our auditomatic.org servers

If your browser or operating system is hacked or otherwise compromised, then an attacker could gain access to the locally-stored data. The desktop version is more secure from browser-based attacks.  

## Data Usage

If you opt in to analytics, the aggregate data via GoatCounter helps us:
- Understand how many people are using Auditomatic across different countries and systems
- Identify technical issues (e.g., browser compatibility)
- Improve the website and application experience

## Legal Basis

For the web application and desktop app, we collect anonymous analytics data only with your explicit consent. You have full control over whether analytics are enabled, and you can change your preference at any time through the app's settings.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Opt out** of analytics collection at any time through the application settings
- **Opt in** to analytics if you initially declined
- **Use the application fully** without enabling analytics - all features work regardless of your analytics preference

Because we do not collect personally identifiable information (even if you opt in to analytics), there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. All data collected is anonymous and aggregated.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this URL.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/auditomatic/lite-app) or auditomatic@stuartgeiger.com.
